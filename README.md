# Description

This project introduces the use of models and animations. Three areas are presented in front of the user, each having a human model and a button. When the user walks up to the different models, they will wave and look at the VR player. When the button next to them is pressed, the models will go into different dance animations along with an accompanying song. The goal of these demonstrations is to help the VR player learn different dance moves. The VR player can repeat these moves at any time.

# Issues

- There was a lot of incompatability between taking animations from Adobe's Mixamo and taking models from Microsoft's Rocketbox. The animations and models were not lined up perfectly so some tweaking was needed.
